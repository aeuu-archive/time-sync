# |  TIME  SYNCHRONIZATION  |

# |       by arctfoxx       |
# +-------------------------+

# The plugin will automatically generate a config file for every world
# Between multiple worlds, the time in each will not be synchronized.

# To synchronize a world with another, use the sync property and set it to be the world to sync to.
# world-demo:
#   sync: world
# The sync property should be present in every world configuration.
# If the sync property is to anything other than "none", the day and night properties are ignored.

# To disable a world from being modified by this plugin, use the ignore property.
# world-demo:
#   ignore: true
# This property is optional and defaults to false.

# +-----------------+
# |  CONFIGURATION  |
# +-----------------+

# This is the default world in the game.
# The day and night properties represent how long a day and night are in seconds.
# This is defaulted to 15 minutes each.
world:
  day: 900
  night: 900
  sync: none
